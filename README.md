Contained is the base library for augmentation as of publication.

Additionally code for the classification module and segmentation is included.

For easy installation and reproduction of results, `libhaa` library is installable by running

pip install -e .
```

For segmentation inference we provide the weights in the `Releases` github panel.
Classification weights will be made available soon.
